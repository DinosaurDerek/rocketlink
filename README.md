## ðŸš€ Rocketlink

**Rocketlink** is a solo-built crypto dashboard demo built with Next.js, designed for the Chromion Hackathon. It integrates Chainlink price feeds and smart contract automation on the Avalanche Fuji testnet.

The app displays real-time token prices, renders historical price charts, and lets users set custom price alerts using Chainlink Automation. Itâ€™s built with React, Emotion, and Ethers.js for a clean, Web3-native frontend experience.

## Demo

## Notes

- This app uses the free tier of the CoinGecko API, which has strict rate limits. This may cause brief delays or failed fetches when switching tokens quickly or refreshing often.
- Error messages are displayed in the UI when rate limits are hit.
